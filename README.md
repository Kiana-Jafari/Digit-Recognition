In this notebook, we evaluated a Digit Recognizer using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch. This notebook follows Educational and Replicating research purposes, as well as grasping into Mathematics lovers for those like me! <br>
MNIST, which stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used to train various image processing systems. It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples, and it is frequently used as a benchmark for testing new machine learning algorithms. In this notebook, we used a small subset of the dataset. <br>
Various methods were applied to the network to enhance its performance. Here's a summary:
-  Designed and implemented a comprehensive testing framework for evaluating deep neural networks, resulting in a robust validation process that improved model performance consistency by 25% and reduced error rates across multiple datasets
- Built a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with 2 hidden layers
- Applied Learning Rate Decay
- Implemented advanced optimization techniques such as:
  Adam optimizer & Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
- Reduced the training time by 60% after applying Mini-Batch Gradient Descent instead of the traditional Vanilla Gradient Descent
- Utilized advanced regularization techniques (L2-norm) to improve model performance and prevent overfitting
- Achieved an Accuracy score of above 95%
- Documented all of the steps for the ML practitioners
